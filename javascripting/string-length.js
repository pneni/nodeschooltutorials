/* 
STRING LENGTH (Exercise 4 of 19)  
   
  You will often need to know how many characters are in a string.  
   
  For this you will use the .length property. Here's an example:  
   
     var example = 'example string';  
     example.length  
   
 ## NOTE  
   
  Make sure there is a period between example and length.  
   
  The above code will return a number for the total number of characters in  
  the string. 
*/

var example = 'example string';
console.log(example.length);
