/*
FUNCTIONS (Exercise 17 of 19)  
   
  A function is a block of code that takes input, processes that input, and  
  then produces output.  
   
  Here is an example:  
   
     function example (x) {  
       return x * 2;  
     }  
   
  We can call that function like this to get the number 10:  
   
     example(5)  
   
  The above example assumes that the example function will take a number as  
  an argument –– as input –– and will return that number multiplied by 2.
