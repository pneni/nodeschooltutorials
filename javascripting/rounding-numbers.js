 ## ROUNDING NUMBERS (Exercise 7 of 19)  
   
  We can do basic math using familiar operators like +, -, *, /, and %.  
   
  For more complex math, we can use the Math object.  
  We will use the Math.round() method to round the number up. This method  
  rounds either up or down to the nearest integer.

var roundUp = 1.5;
var rounded = Math.round(roundUp);
console.log(rounded);
